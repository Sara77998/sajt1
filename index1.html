                <p>Since graduating from high school, I have seen more corners of the world and had more heart stopping adventures than most will ever see. I might be found hanging from a helicopter over a Hawaiian volcano, sledding down a Swiss glacier at sunset, making friends with Alpacas in the mountains of Peru, capturing sunrise over a misty coconut plantation in Bali, exploring the pristine sand dunes of South Africa, exploring the ocean floor in a mini submarine or waist deep in the water on a starry night on Bowen Island.</p>
